# COMP3208Coursework
Recommender Systems built for COMP3208 (2023/24)

## Aim of Coursework
The aim of the coursework is to build and evaluate realistic recommender system algorithms. This is 
broken down into two assignments, each testing a different element of the overall goal. 

## Task 1
The source_code must code a cosine similarity recommender system algorithm to train and then 
predict ratings for a small (100k) set of items.

## Task 2 
The source_code must code a large-scale matrix factorisation recommender system algorithm to 
train and then predict ratings for a large (20M) set of items. You may need to use a database to 
handle the large numbers of ratings.
